COPY-MOVE FORGERY DETECTION

1. Introduction
---
This package contains the Matlab implementation of the copy-move detection approach presented in Amerini et al., TIFS 2011. Our code use several public functions and libraries developed by other authors; regarding these files, for any problem or license information, please refer to the respective authors.
In particular, SIFT features are extracted using the Rob Hess implementation (http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/hess/code/sift/). Anyway, the code works also loading features extraced with other implementations (such as the original one by D. Lowe).


2. Main functions
---
- process_image(imagefile, metric, thc, min_cluster_pts, plotimg, extractsift)

The function runs Copy-Move-Detection on a single image. For example run from the Matlab prompt:
>> process_image('examples/tampered1.jpg', 'ward', 3, 4, 1)

You can also import a file containing sift descriptors if you have pre-computed features:
>> process_image('examples/tampered2.jpg', 'ward', 3, 4, 1, 'examples/tampered2.sift')

- run_F220_experiment and run_F2000_experiment

These two scripts can be used to replicate the experiments reported in our paper; you have only to download these two datasets and unzip them into the 'dataset' directory. You can find this data at the URL:
http://www.micc.unifi.it/ballan/research/image-forensics/

Please note that you will probably obtain very similar (but not the same) results with respect to those reported in our paper since, in that case, we applied a 4-fold cross validation procedure that is not implemented in these scripts. The expected results are reported in a text file in the dataset directory.
